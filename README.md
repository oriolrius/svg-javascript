# Playing with SVG files from JavaScript code

Very basic introduction, but useful, about how to load an SVG file from HTML and modify the content also binding mouse events to actions. Play with SVG DOM structure can be very useful for many projects.

I hope this is useful for you, target of this content is for HTML/JavaScript programmers which are not familiar with SVG graphical format.

There is a video which explain the code and show the behaviour.
